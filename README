Our RayTracer has implemented all the mandatory features, and also allows for the interpolation of vertex normals in .obj files. 

To compile the program, run "make" from within the source directory.

To run the program, run "./raytracer [scene filename] [output filename]". 
[scene file] is the path to the input scene file.
[output file] is an optional argument to the output image. If [output file] is not specified, the default output file name is "output.png"
